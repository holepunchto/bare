# Bare

Small and modular JavaScript runtime for desktop and mobile. Like Node.js, it provides an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for writing applications in the lingua franca of modern software. Unlike Node.js, it makes embedding and cross-device support core use cases, aiming to run just as well on your phone as on your laptop. The result is a runtime ideal for networked, peer-to-peer applications that can run on a wide selection of hardware.

## Usage

This module exports the global `Bare` namespace. See <https://github.com/holepunchto/bare#api> for the API documentation.

```js
const Bare = require('bare')
```
