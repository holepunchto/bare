# :pear:.js

Small and modular JavaScript runtime for desktop and mobile. Like Node.js, it provides an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for writing applications in the lingua franca of modern software. Unlike Node.js, it makes embedding and cross-device support core use cases, aiming to run just as well on your phone as on your laptop. The result is a runtime ideal for networked, peer-to-peer applications that can run on a wide selection of hardware.

## Usage

```sh
$ pear [-m, --import-map <path>] <filename>
```

## API

### `process`

The core JavaScript API of :pear:.js is available through the global `process` object, which is also available by importing the builtin `process` module. The `process` object provides information about, and control over, the :pear:.js process and also provides access to core functionality like loading native addons.

#### `process.platform`

The identifier of the operating system for which :pear:.js was compiled. The possible values are `android`, `darwin`, `ios`, `linux`, and `win32`.

#### `process.arch`

The identifier of the processor architecture for which :pear:.js was compiled. The possible values are `arm`, `arm64`, `ia32`, and `x64`.

#### `process.execPath`

The absolute path, with any symbolic links resolved, to the binary that started the current process.

#### `process.argv`

The command line arguments passed to the process when launched.

#### `process.pid`

The ID of the current process.

#### `process.title`

The title of the current process. Assigning a new value will change the title of the process. On platforms where the process title is backed by a buffer with a fixed size, the new title will be truncated if larger than the previous title. See <http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_set_process_title> for more information.

#### `process.exitCode`

The code that will be returned once the process exits. If the process is exited using `process.exit()` without specifying a code, `process.exitCode` is used.

#### `process.env`

The current user environment. If modified, the changes will be visible to JavaScript and native code running in the current process, including threads, but will not be reflected outside of it.

#### `process.versions`

An object containing the version strings of :pear:.js and its dependencies.

#### `process.thread`

A reference to the current thread. Will be `null` on the main thread. See [Threads](#threads) for more information.

#### `process.cwd()`

Get the current working directory of the process.

#### `process.chdir(directory)`

Change the current working directory of the process.

#### `process.exit([code])`

Synchronously exit the current process with an exit status of `code` which defaults to `process.exitCode`. The process will not terminate until all `exit` event listeners have been called.

#### `process.suspend()`

Suspend the current process. This will emit a `suspend` event signalling that all work should stop immediately. When all work has stopped and the process would otherwise exit, an `idle` event will be emitted. If the process is not resumed from an `idle` event listener, the loop will block and allow no further work until the process is resumed.

#### `process.resume()`

Resume the process after suspension. This can be used to cancel process suspension after the `suspend` event has been emitted and up until all `idle` event listeners have run.

#### `process.addon(specifier)`

Load a static or dynamic native addon identified by `specifier`. If `specifier` is not a static native addon, :pear:.js will instead look for a matching dynamic object library using `process.addon.resolve()`. Modules with native addons can use this mechanism to export their bindings, such as by doing `module.exports = process.addon(__dirname)` from the root of the module. This will allow them to be used in both static and dynamic contexts.

#### `process.addon.resolve(specifier)`

Resolve a dynamic native addon specifier by searching for a dynamic object library matching `specifier`.

#### `process.hrtime([previous])`

Get the current high-resolution real time as a `[seconds, nanoseconds]` 32-bit unsigned integer tuple. If `previous` is specified, the returned tuple will contain the delta from the `previous` time.

#### `process.hrtime.bigint()`

Get the current high-resolution real time in nanoseconds as a `bigint`.

#### `process.nextTick(callback[, ...args])`

A wrapper around `queueMicrotask()` for compatibility purposes.

#### `process.on('uncaughtException', err)`

Emitted when a JavaScript exception is thrown within an exectuion context without being caught by any exception handlers within that execution context. By default, uncaught exceptions are printed to `stderr` and the processes exited with an exit status of 1. Adding an event listener for the `uncaughtException` event overrides the default behavior.

#### `process.on('unhandledRejection', reason, promise)`

Emitted when a JavaScript promise is rejected within an execution context without that rejection being handled within that execution context. By default, unhandled rejections are printed to `stderr` and the process exited with an exit status of 1. Adding an event listener for the `unhandledRejection` event overrides the default behavior.

#### `process.on('beforeExit', code)`

Emitted when the loop runs out of work and before the process exits. This provides a chance to schedule additional work and keep the process from exiting. If additional work is scheduled, `beforeExit` will be emitted again once the loop runs out of work.

If the process is exited explicitly, such as by calling `process.exit()` or as the result of an uncaught exception, the `beforeExit` event will not be emitted.

#### `process.on('exit', code)`

Emitted just before the process terminates. Any additional work scheduled after `exit` has been emitted will not be performed and so event listeners can only perform synchronous operations.

All registered `exit` event listeners will be called before the process terminates. An event listener may override the final exit code by setting `process.exitCode` or by calling `process.exit(code)`. Calling `process.exit()` from an `exit` event listener will not prevent the remaining event listeners from running.

#### `process.on('suspend')`

Emitted when the process is suspended. Any in-progress or outstanding work, such as network activity or file system access, should be deferred, cancelled, or paused when the `suspend` event is emitted and no additional work may be scheduled.

#### `process.on('idle')`

Emitted when the process becomes idle after suspension. After this, the loop will block and no additional work be performed until the process is resumed. An `idle` event listener may call `process.resume()` to cancel the suspension.

#### `process.on('resume')`

Emitted when the process resumes after suspension. Deferred and paused work should be continued when the `resume` event is emitted and new work may again be scheduled.

### Threads

The builtin `thread` module provides support for lightweight threads. Threads are similar to workers in Node.js, but provide only minimal API surface for creating and joining threads.

#### `Thread.isMainThread`

`true` if the current thread is the main thread.

#### `const thread = new Thread(filename[, options])`

Start a new thread that will load and run `filename`.

Options include:

```js
{
  source: Buffer, // Optional file source, will be read from `filename` if not provided
  data: Buffer // Optional thread data
}
```

#### `thread.join()`

Block and wait for the thread to exit.

#### `process.thread`

A reference to the current thread. Will be `null` on the main thread.

#### `process.thread.data`

A copy of the `data` buffer that was passed to the current thread on creation. Will be `null` if no buffer was passed.

#### `process.thread.stop()`

Stop and exit the current thread as soon as possible.

#### `process.thread.on('exit')`

Emitted when the current thread exits.

### Modules

In addition to the core `process` and `thread` modules, :pear:.js provides a small selection of builtin modules to cover the most basic use cases, primarily those of the runtime itself:

- `assert` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-assert>)
- `buffer` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-buffer>)
- `console` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-console>)
- `events` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-events>)
- `module` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-module>)
- `path` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-path>)
- `timers` (<https://github.com/holepunchto/pearjs-timers>)

### Embedding

:pear:.js can easily be embedded using the C API defined in [`include/pear.h`](include/pear.h):

```c
#include <pear.h>
#include <uv.h>

pear_t pear;
pear_setup(uv_default_loop(), &pear, argc, argv);

pear_run(&pear, filename, source);

int exit_code;
pear_teardown(&pear, &exit_code);
```

If `source` is `NULL`, the contents of `filename` will instead be read at runtime.

### Suspension

:pear:.js provides a mechanism for implementing process suspension, which is needed for platforms with strict application lifecycle constraints, such as mobile platforms. When suspended, a `suspend` event will be emitted on the `process` object. Then, when the loop has no work left and would otherwise exit, an `idle` event will be emitted and the loop blocked, keeping it from exiting. When the process is later resumed, a `resume` event will be emitted and the loop unblocked, allowing it to exit when no work is left.

The suspension API is available through `pear_suspend()` and `pear_resume()` from C and `process.suspend()` and `process.resume()` from JavaScript. See [`example/suspend.js`](example/suspend.js) for an example of using the suspension API from JavaScript.

## Building

To build :pear:.js, start by installing the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Next, configure the build tree before performing the first build:

```sh
$ npm run configure -- [--debug]
```

Finally, perform the build:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

When completed, the `pear` binary will be available in the `build/bin` directory and the `libpear.(a|lib)` and `(lib)pear.(dylib|dll)` libraries will be available in the root of the `build` directory.

### Linking

When linking against the static `libpear.(a|lib)` library, make sure to use whole archive linking as :pear:.js relies on constructor functions for registering native addons. Without whole archive linking, the linker will remove the constructor functions as they aren't referenced by anything.
